# Multiclass-Classification
Classification using CIFAR-10 dataset

In this experiment, we aim to classify the images from CIFAR-10 datasets into 10 different classes. The solution to this task was approached by implementing
Neural Network with a hidden layer and investigated different tricks to improve the learning over time. The tricks were derived from the learning from back-propagation of error, which acts as the core of Neural Network. The accuracy 
improved with the addition of the tricks of trade like Momentum, Regularization and Activationâ€™s. In addition, the network was tested with different topology to
understand the behavior against different architectures.

### Execution

The following will run the program with default config.
```bash
$ python main.py 
```

You can make the necessary changes in config.yaml.
